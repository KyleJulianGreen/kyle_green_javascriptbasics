				<h1>JavaScript Basics</h1>
				<br>
				<p>JavaScript is cross-platform, object oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>

			<ul>
				<li class="sub">
					<a href="">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript varibles are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be indentified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers, <span>var x;</span>
				</li>
				<li class="sub">
					<a href="">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured into it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operater assigns a value to a variable. <span>var x = 10;</span>
				</li>
				<li class="sub">
					<a href="">Data Types</a> Data Types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span>true</span> or <span>false;</span> null - <span>null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span>42</span> or <span>3.14159;</span> String - <span>"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array - <span>[1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span>{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</span>
				</li>
				<li class="sub">
					<a href="">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to preform different actions for different decision - hitting different code blocks based on values and conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. They are following conditional statements: <span>if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span>else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span>else</span> we execute this block of code;
				</li>
				<li class="sub">
					<a href="">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in any programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!
				</li>
				<li class="sub">
					<a href="">Function</a> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run our code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way way up. Done! We finished our instruction. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over an over and over again.
